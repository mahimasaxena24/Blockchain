Consensus Demo

Consensus Mechanism Simulation:
PoW selected validator with power: 50
Selection Logic: In Proof of Work (PoW), the validator with the highest computational power is selected to mine the next block.
PoS selected validator with stake: 67
Selection Logic: In Proof of Stake (PoS), the validator with the highest stake (investment) is selected to create the next block.
DPoS selected validator with votes: 19
Selection Logic: In Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), a validator is randomly selected based on the votes they received from stakeholders.
